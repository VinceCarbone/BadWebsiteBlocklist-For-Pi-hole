# BadWebsiteBlocklist-For-Pi-hole
Pi-hole compatible adlist built from popcar2's "BadWebsiteBlocklist" repo

All credit for building the list belongs to popcar2 and their repo https://github.com/popcar2/BadWebsiteBlocklist

This is a simple powershell script I wrote that will read popcar2's list and extract a pi-hole compatible version of the list. I have this running as a scheduled task to keep the txt file current.
